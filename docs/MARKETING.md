# Swarmrise Marketing Strategy

## Last Updated
2026-02-20

## Executive Summary

Swarmrise is a European-first collaborative organization management platform built for teams practicing sociocratic, holacratic, or other distributed governance models. It combines real-time chat, org structure management, embedded governance tools (consent-based decisions, voting, candidateless elections), Kanban task boards, policy management, and visual org charts into a single, modern platform.

Our pricing strategy is built on five principles:
1. **Radical simplicity** -- One free tier, one paid tier. No confusing feature matrices, no "contact sales" gatekeeping. Teams should understand pricing in 10 seconds.
2. **Aggressive affordability** -- At 3.49 EUR/member/month, Swarmrise is the cheapest purpose-built governance platform on the market. We undercut GlassFrog by 50%, Holaspirit by 60-75%, and compete with generic tools that have zero governance capabilities.
3. **Generous free tier** -- Up to 15 members with full features. No feature gates, no artificial limitations on governance tools. The only conversion trigger is team size.
4. **Reseller-powered growth** -- Sociocracy coaches, holacracy facilitators, and independent HR consultants are our primary go-to-market channel. They earn up to 1 EUR per paying seat they bring in, creating a sustainable partnership model.
5. **AI-aware positioning** -- We anticipate that AI will commoditize generic collaboration features. Our moat is domain-specific governance tooling that requires deep understanding of sociocracy, not just engineering effort.

**Price point**: Free for up to 15 members, then 3.49 EUR/member/month for every member beyond 15. Full features on every tier.

## Customer Segments

### Segment 1: Sociocracy/Holacracy Practitioners (Primary)
**Description**: Organizations that have explicitly adopted a sociocratic or holacratic governance framework. They understand circles, roles, consent-based decision-making, and elections without candidates. They are actively looking for tools that match their governance model.

- **Size**: 5-200 members per org, typically nonprofits, cooperatives, social enterprises, Agile consultancies
- **Willingness to pay**: Moderate (2-8 EUR/user/month). Many are mission-driven orgs with limited budgets, but they deeply value tools that match their process.
- **Current tools**: GlassFrog, Holaspirit/Talkspirit, Loomio, spreadsheets, Notion wikis, or manual processes
- **Pain points**: Existing tools are either expensive (Holaspirit at 5-13 EUR/user), limited in features (GlassFrog free tier), or don't integrate communication with governance (Loomio has no real-time chat; GlassFrog has no messaging)
- **Why Swarmrise wins**: All-in-one platform -- chat, governance, org structure, Kanban, policies. At 3.49 EUR/member/month, we are the most affordable purpose-built option. No need to stitch together Slack + Loomio + GlassFrog.
- **Geographic concentration**: Strong in Europe (Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium, Scandinavia), growing in North America and Latin America
- **Priority**: HIGH -- these are early adopters who will champion the product

### Segment 2: Agile / Self-Organizing Tech Teams
**Description**: Software teams, product teams, and tech startups experimenting with flat hierarchies, squad models, or self-management. They may not use formal sociocracy but value distributed decision-making.

- **Size**: 10-50 members per team/org
- **Willingness to pay**: Moderate to high (5-12 EUR/user/month). Tech budgets typically accommodate SaaS tools well.
- **Current tools**: Slack + Notion + Jira/Linear, sometimes Miro or Confluence
- **Pain points**: Decision-making happens informally in Slack threads, is hard to trace, and lacks structure. No audit trail for governance decisions.
- **Why Swarmrise wins**: Embedded governance tools within chat (no context switching). Visual org charts with D3 force graphs. Decision audit trail built in. And at 3.49 EUR/member/month, it costs less than half of Slack Pro.
- **Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH -- larger addressable market, but requires education about governance tooling

### Segment 3: Cooperatives and Social Enterprises
**Description**: Worker cooperatives, housing cooperatives, community organizations, and social enterprises that practice democratic governance by nature.

- **Size**: 10-100 members
- **Willingness to pay**: Low to moderate (2-5 EUR/user/month). Budget-constrained, often volunteer-run.
- **Current tools**: Email, Google Docs, Loomio, Slack free tier
- **Pain points**: Governance processes are cumbersome. Decision-making takes too long. No unified platform for communication and governance.
- **Why Swarmrise wins**: Free tier for small co-ops (up to 15 members covers many cooperatives entirely). At 3.49 EUR/member/month for larger co-ops, we are significantly cheaper than Loomio's flat-rate plans. Modern UX vs. dated alternatives. All governance and communication in one place.
- **Priority**: MEDIUM -- passionate users and strong word-of-mouth, but lower revenue potential per org

### Segment 4: Mid-Size Companies Exploring New Governance (Future)
**Description**: Companies with 50-500 employees that are moving away from traditional hierarchies. Often driven by a progressive CEO, HR leader, or organizational coach.

- **Size**: 50-500 members
- **Willingness to pay**: High (8-15 EUR/user/month). Enterprise budgets available.
- **Current tools**: Microsoft Teams / Slack + custom processes, sometimes Holaspirit or consulting engagements
- **Pain points**: Transformation is hard without tooling that embodies the new governance model. Current tools reinforce old hierarchies.
- **Why Swarmrise wins**: Purpose-built for the governance model they're adopting. At 3.49 EUR/member/month, the ROI argument is trivial -- a 100-person org pays under 350 EUR/month for a full governance platform.
- **Priority**: LOW (for now) -- may eventually need enterprise add-ons (SSO, compliance, dedicated infra) that justify premium pricing, but we avoid multi-tier complexity for now

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Model: Single Paid Tier, Per-Member, Size-Based Conversion

We use a radically simple pricing model: **free up to 15 members, then 3.49 EUR/member/month for every member beyond 15**. All features are available on every tier. The only difference between free and paid is organization size.

**Why single-tier, not multi-tier?** Multi-tier pricing (Free / Pro / Business / Enterprise) creates cognitive overhead for buyers, forces artificial feature segmentation, and adds complexity to the product (feature flags, tier checks). With a single paid tier, every user gets the same experience. The product team ships one version. The marketing message is simple: "Free for small teams. 3.49 EUR/member/month when you grow."

**Why per-member, not per-org or usage-based?** Per-member pricing scales naturally with the value an organization gets from Swarmrise -- more members means more governance interactions, more decisions, more value. It is also the market standard for collaboration tools (Slack, Notion, GlassFrog all use per-seat), so buyers understand it immediately.

**Why 3.49 EUR?** This price point is strategic:
- It is 50% cheaper than GlassFrog Premium (approximately 6.44 EUR/user at current exchange rates)
- It is 30-75% cheaper than Holaspirit/Talkspirit (5-13 EUR/user/month)
- It is cheaper than Slack Pro (approximately 6.67 EUR/user/month) while offering governance tools Slack lacks entirely
- At our infrastructure costs (0.06-0.14 EUR/user/month), we maintain 96%+ gross margins
- It falls within the willingness-to-pay range of our primary segment (2-8 EUR/user/month)
- The psychological price point below 3.50 EUR feels notably cheaper than competitor prices of 5-7+ EUR

**Why EUR, not USD?** Swarmrise is a European-first business. The sociocracy and holacracy community has deep roots in Europe (Netherlands, Germany, France, Belgium). Pricing in EUR eliminates currency uncertainty for our primary market and signals European identity. International customers pay in EUR as well -- this simplifies billing and accounting.

### Pricing Tiers

#### Free Tier
**Price**: 0 EUR/month
**Limits**: Up to 15 members per organization

| Feature | Included |
|---------|----------|
| Organization management | Yes |
| Teams and roles (leader, secretary, referee) | Yes |
| Real-time chat (org, team, DM channels) | Yes |
| Consent-based topics | Yes |
| Voting | Yes |
| Candidateless elections | Yes |
| Visual org chart (D3 force graph) | Yes |
| Kanban boards | Yes |
| Policy management | Yes |
| Decision audit trail | Full history |
| Notifications (in-app + email) | Yes |
| File storage | 500 MB per org |
| Message search | Yes |
| Thread support | Yes |
| Data export | Yes |

**Rationale**: The free tier is deliberately generous -- full features, no artificial limits beyond the 15-member cap. We want teams to experience the complete governance workflow (topics, consent, voting, elections, policies, audit trail) without any friction. This drives word-of-mouth: "We used Swarmrise to run a real consent round, candidateless election, and policy review for free."

**Competitive positioning**: GlassFrog's free tier caps at 10 users. Loomio has no free tier (14-day trial only). Slack's free tier loses message history after 90 days. Our 15-member free tier with full features and full history is a strong differentiator. Many small sociocratic organizations (circles, cooperatives, community groups) will fit entirely within the free tier -- and that is intentional. They become advocates.

#### Paid Tier
**Price**: 3.49 EUR/member/month (for each member beyond 15)
**Billing**: Monthly. No annual contract required.

| Feature | Included |
|---------|----------|
| Everything in Free | Yes |
| Unlimited members | Yes |
| File storage | Scales with org size (500 MB base + 100 MB per member) |
| Priority email support | Yes |

**How billing works**: An organization with 25 members pays for 10 members (25 minus 15 free): 10 x 3.49 EUR = 34.90 EUR/month. An organization with 50 members pays for 35 members: 35 x 3.49 EUR = 122.15 EUR/month.

**Rationale**: At 3.49 EUR/member/month, we are the most affordable purpose-built governance tool on the market. A 30-person organization pays 52.35 EUR/month -- less than the cost of a single Loomio Pro subscription (approximately 76 EUR/month) and less than half what they would pay for GlassFrog Premium (30 x 6.44 EUR = 193 EUR/month). The pricing makes the adoption decision trivially easy: budget approval is almost never a blocker at this price point.

### Pricing Examples

| Org Size | Free Members | Paid Members | Monthly Cost | Cost per Actual Member |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| 10 members | 10 | 0 | 0 EUR | 0.00 EUR |
| 15 members | 15 | 0 | 0 EUR | 0.00 EUR |
| 20 members | 15 | 5 | 17.45 EUR | 0.87 EUR |
| 30 members | 15 | 15 | 52.35 EUR | 1.75 EUR |
| 50 members | 15 | 35 | 122.15 EUR | 2.44 EUR |
| 100 members | 15 | 85 | 296.65 EUR | 2.97 EUR |
| 200 members | 15 | 185 | 645.65 EUR | 3.23 EUR |

**Note**: The effective per-member cost decreases as the organization grows because the first 15 members are always free. This creates a natural volume discount without needing complex tiered pricing. A 100-person org pays an effective rate of 2.97 EUR/member -- less than half of any governance competitor.

### Future Considerations: Enterprise Add-Ons

We deliberately avoid a multi-tier model at launch. However, as we grow, certain features may justify premium pricing as add-ons rather than gated tiers:

- **SSO/SAML integration**: May be offered as an add-on for organizations requiring it (common in enterprise procurement)
- **Dedicated infrastructure**: For organizations with data residency or compliance requirements
- **AI-powered governance features**: When we build AI meeting facilitation, decision summarization, etc.
- **Custom SLAs and support**: For organizations needing guaranteed response times

These would be priced as transparent add-ons on top of the 3.49 EUR/member/month base, not as separate tiers. This preserves pricing simplicity while capturing willingness-to-pay from larger organizations.

## Reseller & Referral Program

### The Practitioner Channel

Sociocracy coaches, holacracy facilitators, organizational development consultants, and independent HR consultants are the most influential recommenders in our target market. When a coach works with an organization to implement sociocratic governance, they often recommend specific tools. This is our primary go-to-market channel.

### Program Structure

**Who qualifies**: Independent consultants, coaches, and facilitators who work with organizations on governance, self-management, or organizational development. This includes:
- Certified sociocracy trainers and consultants (e.g., from Sociocracy for All, The Sociocracy Group)
- Holacracy coaches and practitioners
- Agile coaches and Scrum Masters focused on organizational design
- Independent HR consultants working on governance transformation
- Cooperative development consultants

**Commission**: Up to **1 EUR per paying seat per month** for as long as the referred organization remains a paying customer.

**How it works**:
1. Reseller signs up for the Swarmrise Partner Program (free)
2. Reseller receives a unique referral link/code
3. When an organization signs up through the referral link and exceeds 15 members, the reseller earns commission on every paying seat
4. Commission is paid monthly, with a minimum payout threshold of 25 EUR

**Example earnings**:
- A coach refers 5 organizations, each with 30 members (15 paying seats each): 75 paying seats x 1 EUR = 75 EUR/month recurring
- A facilitator refers 10 organizations averaging 50 members (35 paying seats each): 350 paying seats x 1 EUR = 350 EUR/month recurring
- An active reseller building a portfolio of 20+ organizations: 500+ EUR/month recurring

### Economics of the Reseller Program

**Commission as percentage of revenue**: 1 EUR out of 3.49 EUR = 28.7% of revenue. This is a significant share, but justified because:
- Resellers provide warm, qualified leads (near-zero customer acquisition cost for these orgs)
- Resellers handle initial education and onboarding (reducing our support burden)
- Resellers create long-term retention (their ongoing consulting relationship keeps the org on Swarmrise)
- The alternative -- paid digital advertising for a niche governance tool -- would likely cost more than 28.7% of lifetime revenue

**Net margin per referred seat**: 3.49 EUR revenue - 1.00 EUR commission - ~0.06 EUR infrastructure = **2.43 EUR net per seat/month** (approximately 70% net margin after commission). This is healthy.

**Reseller incentive alignment**: The recurring nature of the commission aligns the reseller's interests with ours -- they benefit from retention, not just acquisition. If they recommend Swarmrise and the organization churns, the reseller loses income too.

### Reseller Enablement

We provide resellers with:
- Partner dashboard showing referred organizations, seat counts, and earnings
- Co-branded onboarding materials they can customize for their clients
- Early access to new features and roadmap visibility
- Priority support channel for partner-referred organizations
- Listing in a public directory of certified Swarmrise partners (optional)

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors (Governance Tools)

| Tool | Pricing | Swarmrise Price Advantage | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------|---------|--------------------------|-----------|------------|
| **GlassFrog** | Free (10 users) / ~6.44 EUR/user/mo Premium | **48% cheaper** (3.49 vs 6.44 EUR) | Purpose-built for Holacracy, strong meeting support, established brand | No real-time chat, no Kanban, dated UI, Holacracy-specific (not sociocracy-friendly) |
| **Holaspirit/Talkspirit** | ~5-13 EUR/user/mo | **30-73% cheaper** (3.49 vs 5-13 EUR) | Rich governance + communication suite, OKR support | Expensive, complex onboarding, merged product identity is confusing |
| **Loomio** | ~30-76 EUR/mo flat (org-based) | **Cheaper for 20+ member orgs** | Strong cooperative community, robust async decision-making | No real-time chat, no org structure management, dated UI, no free tier |

**Price conversion note**: GlassFrog prices in USD. At 1 USD = 0.92 EUR, their $7/user/month Premium tier is approximately 6.44 EUR/user/month. Loomio's $39-99/month plans convert to approximately 36-91 EUR/month.

### Adjacent Competitors (Collaboration Platforms)

| Tool | Pricing (EUR equivalent) | Overlap | Why Users Choose Swarmrise Instead |
|------|--------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| **Slack** | Free / ~6.67 EUR/user/mo Pro | Real-time chat, channels, threads | Slack has zero governance features. Decisions happen in unstructured threads with no audit trail. Swarmrise is 48% cheaper than Slack Pro and includes governance. |
| **Notion** | Free / ~9.20 EUR/user/mo Plus | Wiki, docs, Kanban boards | Notion is a general-purpose workspace. No governance tooling, no real-time chat, no org structure visualization. Swarmrise is 62% cheaper than Notion Plus. |
| **Microsoft Teams** | Included in M365 (~5.50-11.50 EUR/user/mo) | Chat, channels, meetings | Enterprise-focused, no governance features, complex administration. |

### Positioning Statement

> Swarmrise is the most affordable platform that combines real-time team communication with native sociocratic governance tools -- consent-based decision-making, candidateless elections, and structured voting -- in a modern, visual workspace. At 3.49 EUR/member/month, it costs less than half of any comparable governance tool and less than generic chat platforms that have zero governance capabilities. Built in Europe, for organizations worldwide.

## Market Trends & AI Impact

### Collaboration Tool Market (2025-2026)

1. **Consolidation**: Teams want fewer tools, not more. The trend is toward all-in-one platforms (Notion expanding into chat, Slack adding AI, Teams adding everything). Swarmrise benefits from this trend -- we combine chat + governance + org management + Kanban + policies in one place.

2. **AI features becoming table stakes**: Every collaboration tool is adding AI summaries, AI search, AI writing assistance. Users increasingly expect this. For Swarmrise, the opportunity is AI-assisted governance: smart meeting facilitation, decision summarization, role-fit recommendations during elections.

3. **Remote/hybrid work driving governance needs**: Distributed teams need explicit governance structures more than co-located teams. The shift to remote work is a tailwind for governance tooling.

4. **European digital sovereignty**: Growing demand from European organizations for European-built tools with GDPR compliance baked in. Swarmrise's European-first identity is an advantage, particularly for cooperatives and public-sector-adjacent organizations.

### AI-Specific Dynamics

**Commoditization risk**: AI dramatically lowers the cost of building SaaS products. A competent team with AI tools can now build a basic collaboration platform in weeks. This means:
- Generic features (chat, Kanban, file sharing) will not be defensible moats
- Domain-specific features (consent rounds, candidateless elections, sociocratic role structures) ARE defensible because they require deep understanding of governance frameworks, not just engineering skill
- Our differentiation must be rooted in governance domain expertise, not technology
- **Our pricing reflects this reality**: By pricing aggressively at 3.49 EUR/member/month, we make it economically irrational for organizations to build or switch. The build-vs-buy calculus at this price point overwhelmingly favors buying.

**AI feature roadmap considerations**:
- Phase 1 (no AI): Ship the core governance platform, prove product-market fit
- Phase 2 (AI-assisted): Add AI summaries of consent rounds, smart notifications ("This decision has been pending for 5 days"), meeting preparation assistance
- Phase 3 (AI-native): AI facilitation agents that can guide teams through governance processes, suggest role assignments, identify governance patterns and bottlenecks

**Pricing model evolution**: The industry is experimenting with usage-based and outcome-based pricing. Our approach -- simple per-member pricing with no feature gates -- is a deliberate counter-trend. In a market full of complex pricing pages, radical simplicity is a competitive advantage. If we add AI features, they may be offered as a transparent add-on rather than a reason to introduce new tiers.

**Build vs. buy**: As AI lowers development costs, some larger organizations may attempt to build custom governance tools. Our defense is twofold: (1) the governance domain is deceptively complex (consent round facilitation, election algorithms, audit trail compliance), and (2) at 3.49 EUR/member/month, the cost of building and maintaining a custom solution will always exceed what they would pay us.

## Adoption Strategy

### Onboarding Funnel

1. **Sign up** (no credit card required, Clerk authentication with social login)
2. **Create an organization** (guided setup: name, color scheme, initial team structure)
3. **Invite 2-3 team members** (email invitation flow via Resend)
4. **Run your first consent round** (guided tutorial embedded in chat)
5. **Aha moment**: Team experiences a structured consent decision in real-time chat -- this is the moment they understand what Swarmrise does differently

### Conversion Triggers (Free to Paid)

The single conversion trigger is **team size exceeding 15 members**. This is intentional. By removing all other conversion triggers (audit trail limits, feature gates, org limits), we ensure:
- No frustration from hitting artificial walls
- The free-to-paid transition feels natural ("we grew, so we pay") rather than punitive ("we need feature X, so we have to upgrade")
- Word-of-mouth is not dampened by "but you need Pro for that" caveats

**Expected conversion patterns**:
- Small teams (5-15 members) stay on free tier indefinitely -- they are advocates, not revenue
- Growing teams (16-30 members) hit the paid threshold organically as they invite colleagues
- Coach-introduced organizations often start with 20-50 members, entering the paid tier immediately

### Reseller-Driven Growth (Primary Channel)

The reseller/referral program is our primary go-to-market motion. See the **Reseller & Referral Program** section above for full details.

**Why resellers over traditional marketing**: In the sociocracy/holacracy niche, trust is earned through community, not advertising. A coach's recommendation carries more weight than any ad campaign. By sharing up to 1 EUR/seat with resellers, we turn the community's trusted advisors into our sales force.

### Organic Growth Mechanics

1. **Invite flow**: Every member added is a potential user who joins through an invitation. If they like Swarmrise, they bring it to their other organizations.
2. **Consultant/coach multiplier**: With the reseller program, coaches have both intrinsic (good tool for clients) and extrinsic (recurring commission) motivation to recommend Swarmrise.
3. **Community visibility**: The sociocracy/holacracy community is tight-knit. Visibility at conferences (Sociocracy for All, Holacracy events, European cooperative congresses) and in community forums drives organic adoption.
4. **Content marketing**: Publish guides on implementing sociocratic governance with Swarmrise. Target long-tail search terms like "how to run a consent round," "candidateless election tool," "sociocracy software."

### Retention Strategy

- **Data gravity**: As organizations build their decision history, role structures, and policies in Swarmrise, switching costs increase naturally (not through lock-in, but through accumulated organizational knowledge).
- **Governance workflow integration**: Once a team's governance process runs through Swarmrise, it becomes part of their operational rhythm.
- **Reseller relationship**: When a coach recommended Swarmrise, the ongoing coaching relationship reinforces platform usage.
- **Continuous feature development**: Regular releases that address community feedback and expand governance capabilities.
- **Transparent communication**: Publish a public roadmap. Announce pricing changes well in advance. Never surprise users.
- **Aggressive pricing as retention**: At 3.49 EUR/member/month, switching to a more expensive tool is hard to justify. Price is itself a retention mechanism.

## Revenue Model

### Infrastructure Cost Analysis

All costs below are monthly estimates based on current (Feb 2026) vendor pricing. Infrastructure vendors price in USD; we convert to EUR at 1 USD = 0.92 EUR for comparison with our EUR-denominated revenue.

#### Convex (Backend/Database)

| Plan | Cost (USD) | Cost (EUR) | Included |
|------|------------|------------|----------|
| Free/Starter | $0 | 0 EUR | 1M function calls, 0.5 GB DB storage, 1 GB bandwidth, 1 GB file storage |
| Professional | $25/dev/month | ~23 EUR/dev/month | 25M function calls, 50 GB DB storage, 50 GB bandwidth, 100 GB file storage |

**Cost model for Swarmrise**: With a small development team (1-3 developers), the Professional plan at $25-75/month (~23-69 EUR/month) covers early growth. Overage costs for function calls ($2/million = ~1.84 EUR/million) and database storage ($0.20/GB = ~0.18 EUR/GB) are the main scaling concerns.

**Estimated cost per user**:
- A typical active user generates ~500 function calls/day (~15,000/month)
- At 1,000 active users: ~15M function calls/month (within Professional plan's 25M)
- Database storage grows at ~1 MB/user/month (messages, decisions, org data)
- **Marginal cost per user: ~0.03-0.05 EUR/month** at moderate scale (1,000 users)
- At high scale (10,000+ users): **~0.04-0.07 EUR/user/month**

#### Clerk (Authentication)

| Plan | Cost (USD) | Cost (EUR) | Included |
|------|------------|------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 0 EUR | 50,000 MRUs (monthly registered users) |
| Pro | $25/month | ~23 EUR/month | 50,000 MRUs included, then $0.02/user (~0.018 EUR/user) for 50K-100K |

**Cost model for Swarmrise**: Clerk's free tier is extremely generous at 50,000 MRUs. We will not hit this limit for a very long time. Clerk is effectively free for our first several years of growth.

#### Resend (Email)

| Plan | Cost (USD) | Cost (EUR) | Included |
|------|------------|------------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 0 EUR | 3,000 emails/month (100/day) |
| Pro | $20/month | ~18.40 EUR/month | 50,000 emails/month, $0.90/1,000 after (~0.83 EUR/1,000) |

**Cost model for Swarmrise**: Emails are sent for invitations, notification digests, and transactional events. A typical organization sends ~5-10 emails/member/month.

#### Hosting (Vite Static Frontend)

The React frontend is a static SPA built with Vite, deployed to a CDN (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or similar).

- **Cost**: 0-20 EUR/month for most static hosting platforms
- **Per-user cost**: Negligible (static assets cached on CDN)

### Total Infrastructure Cost Per User

| Scale | Convex | Clerk | Resend | Hosting | Total/User/Month (EUR) |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|---------|----------------------|
| 100 users | 0.05 EUR | 0.00 EUR | 0.00 EUR | 0.09 EUR | ~0.14 EUR |
| 1,000 users | 0.04 EUR | 0.00 EUR | 0.02 EUR | 0.01 EUR | ~0.07 EUR |
| 5,000 users | 0.05 EUR | 0.00 EUR | 0.01 EUR | 0.00 EUR | ~0.06 EUR |
| 10,000 users | 0.06 EUR | 0.00 EUR | 0.01 EUR | 0.00 EUR | ~0.07 EUR |
| 50,000 users | 0.07 EUR | 0.02 EUR | 0.01 EUR | 0.00 EUR | ~0.10 EUR |

**Key insight**: Our marginal infrastructure cost per user is between 0.06 and 0.14 EUR depending on scale. At our 3.49 EUR/member/month price point, we achieve **96-98% gross margins** on infrastructure costs alone. Even after reseller commissions (up to 1 EUR/seat for referred customers), we maintain **70%+ gross margins on referred seats** and **96%+ on organic seats**.

### Margin Analysis

**Assumptions**:
- Free tier users cost us ~0.06-0.14 EUR/user/month in infrastructure
- Free-to-paid conversion is driven by org size, not feature gates
- Estimated 40-60% of registered users are in organizations above the 15-member free threshold
- Reseller-referred organizations account for 30-50% of paid seats (with up to 1 EUR/seat commission)
- Average paying organization size: 30 members (15 paying seats)
- Revenue per paying seat: 3.49 EUR/month

**Revenue per organization scenarios**:

| Org Size | Total Members | Paying Members | Monthly Revenue | With Reseller Commission | Net After Commission |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Small | 20 | 5 | 17.45 EUR | -5.00 EUR (if referred) | 12.45 EUR |
| Medium | 40 | 25 | 87.25 EUR | -25.00 EUR (if referred) | 62.25 EUR |
| Large | 80 | 65 | 226.85 EUR | -65.00 EUR (if referred) | 161.85 EUR |
| Very Large | 150 | 135 | 471.15 EUR | -135.00 EUR (if referred) | 336.15 EUR |

**Year 1 revenue projections**:

| Metric | Conservative | Realistic | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Total registered users | 2,000 | 5,000 | 12,000 |
| Users in paid orgs (above 15-member threshold) | 600 | 2,000 | 6,000 |
| Paying seats (members beyond 15, across all orgs) | 300 | 1,000 | 3,500 |
| Of which reseller-referred (at 1 EUR commission) | 100 | 400 | 1,500 |
| Gross revenue (MRR) | 1,047 EUR | 3,490 EUR | 12,215 EUR |
| Reseller commissions | -100 EUR | -400 EUR | -1,500 EUR |

**Note**: These projections assume a mix of organic and reseller-driven growth with minimal paid advertising spend. The reseller program is expected to accelerate growth significantly compared to pure organic acquisition.

### Revenue Sustainability Checkpoints

1. **Break-even on infrastructure**: Reached as soon as ~30 paying seats cover Convex Professional + Resend Pro costs (~42 EUR/month). Achievable within weeks of launch with even a single medium-sized organization.
2. **Break-even on one full-time developer**: At ~3,500 EUR MRR net of commissions (around 1,200-1,500 paying seats depending on reseller mix). This is the critical milestone. At realistic growth projections, achievable within 12-18 months.
3. **Sustainable small team**: At ~10,000 EUR MRR net (around 3,500-4,000 paying seats), we can support a small team of 2-3 people.

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Unresolved Strategic Questions

1. **Free tier member limit validation**: 15 members is the current threshold. Should it be 10 (more conservative) or 20 (more generous, increases virality but delays monetization)? Needs validation with early users. Current stance: 15 is the sweet spot -- it covers most small sociocratic circles while ensuring medium organizations pay.

2. **Annual billing discount**: Should we offer a discount for annual prepayment? A 10-15% discount (e.g., 2.99 EUR/member/month billed annually) could improve cash flow predictability. Counter-argument: monthly billing with no commitment reduces adoption friction, which may be more valuable at this stage.

3. **Reseller commission tiers**: The current proposal is up to 1 EUR/seat. Should we scale commission based on volume (e.g., 0.80 EUR for first 100 seats, 1 EUR for 100+) to reward high-performing resellers? Or keep it simple at a flat rate?

4. **AI feature pricing**: When we add AI features (governance facilitation, decision summaries), should they be included in the base price, offered as an add-on (e.g., +1 EUR/member/month), or used as the basis for a future premium tier?

5. **Nonprofit/cooperative discount**: Loomio offers 30-50% nonprofit discounts. At 3.49 EUR/member/month we are already extremely competitive, so a further discount may not be necessary. But offering a symbolic gesture (e.g., 2.99 EUR for registered nonprofits) could strengthen community goodwill.

6. **Enterprise add-ons timeline**: When do we introduce SSO, compliance certifications, and dedicated infrastructure as paid add-ons? Too early adds complexity; too late means losing enterprise deals.

### Planned Experiments

- [ ] **Beta launch with 5-10 sociocracy-practicing organizations**: Gather feedback on pricing sensitivity, onboarding friction, and conversion triggers before public launch.
- [ ] **Reseller pilot**: Recruit 5-10 sociocracy/holacracy coaches for the reseller program. Validate commission structure, onboarding materials, and partner dashboard requirements.
- [ ] **Content marketing pilot**: Publish 5 governance-focused articles and measure organic search traffic and sign-up conversion.
- [ ] **Conference presence**: Attend 1-2 European sociocracy/holacracy conferences to build brand awareness and recruit reseller partners.

### Feature Development Priorities (Marketing Perspective)

1. **Reseller/partner dashboard** -- Required to launch the reseller program (referral tracking, commission reporting, payout management)
2. **Data export** -- Builds trust ("your data is yours"), important for adoption by cautious organizations
3. **SSO/SAML** -- Future enterprise add-on, unlocks larger organization deals
4. **AI meeting summaries** -- High-value feature for future monetization or add-on pricing
5. **API access** -- Enables integrations with existing tools (Slack, calendar apps), reduces switching friction
6. **Mobile app** -- Table stakes for collaboration tools, needed for broad adoption
